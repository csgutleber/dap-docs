Data replication in Data Access Platform (DAP) is based on _tables_. You can synchronize the state of each table individually with the data stored in DAP.

Tables are organized into _namespaces_. For example, the Canvas tables assignments, content\_tags or submissions are in the namespace canvas. The table web\_logs is in the namespace canvas\_logs. Other products have their own namespace, e.g. catalog.

Disclaimer: The data available currently is a ‘best effort’ attempt, and is not guaranteed to be complete or wholly accurate.

## All available namespaces

| Namespace                                                                                                                         | Description                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| [canvas](https://github.com/instructure/api-docu-portal/blob/test/gitbook/services/dap/canvas.md#tables-in-canvas)                | Tables from Canvas.              |
| [canvas\_logs](https://github.com/instructure/api-docu-portal/blob/test/gitbook/services/dap/canvaslogs.md#tables-in-canvas-logs) | Tables representing access logs. |
| [catalog](https://github.com/instructure/api-docu-portal/blob/test/gitbook/services/dap/catalog.md#tables-in-catalog)             | Tables from Catalog.             |

Please note that access to the data in the catalog namespace requires a separate purchase of [Canvas Catalog](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Catalog/What-is-Canvas-Catalog/ta-p/1764).
